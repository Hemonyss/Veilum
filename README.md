## Description

**Veilum: Your message is your business. Stay connected without central restrictions.**

Veilum is a next-generation messenger built on independently operated servers designed to ensure maximum anonymity and digital freedom. We believe private and unrestricted communication is a fundamental right.

### How do we ensure this?
- Independent server infrastructure: Veilum does not rely on a single corporate data center. Servers are run by volunteers around the world, creating a decentralized and resilient network.
- Open-source server software: The server code is publicly available, allowing anyone to verify, deploy, and operate their own node. It is lightweight and optimized to run even on low-end hardware.
- Advanced end-to-end encryption: Veilum uses AES-256 with high-speed OCB mode to keep your messages private while maintaining fast communication.
- Full functionality without compromise: Messaging, high-quality voice and video calls, file sharing, and group chats — all built with privacy and resilience at the core.


### Why is Veilum your choice?
- True anonymity through decentralization: No single authority controls the network.
- Community-powered infrastructure: The network grows and strengthens through volunteer participation.
- Open and verifiable security: Anyone can audit the code and independently verify how the system works.

**YOUR DIGITAL LIFE IS YOURS AND NO ONE ELSE'S**
